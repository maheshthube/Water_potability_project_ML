# Water_potability_project_ML
This project is water potability test based on various features using many ML algorithm.
Developed a machine learning system using decision tree, random forest, and boosting algorithms to assess water potability.
•	Utilized Python, Jupyter IDE, and scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and stats libraries
•	Achieved 80% accuracy with the XG Boost algorithm, outperforming other models.
•	Project contributes to reliable water quality assessment and public health
